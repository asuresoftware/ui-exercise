// Hit ~ 4 hour time limit. Went by very fast

// Didn't end up getting results to populate, possible error using the Yelp API workaround with glitch.me?

// Homepage looks solid, would like results to populate below input form in a modal ideally, with functions for sorting by yelp review

// Given more time, would like to finish trying to get results populating, add animations on homepage with a popup modal...
// ... add leaflet maps with pins for every taco restaurant in a given city.
